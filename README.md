# siam-latex
Modernization of the SIAM LaTeX classes.

The goals for the new style file are in the file:

* requirements.md

The new macros being designed are here:

* siamlatex - The "new" macros being crowdsourced via this project.

Previous versions of the SIAM macros are available in the following
subdirectories:

* siamltex - The "original" that most of us have been using for
             decades.

* siamltex1213 - A newer version that does not support PDFLATEX but
                 does add a few options.

* siamltexmm - The more modern look used by JUQ, SIADS, SIIMS, and
               SIFIN.

* siamltex0315 - A proposed new version that is *not* for use in SIAM
                 submissions. This is just a test.
